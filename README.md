## Project Overview / Proposal
The goal of our project is to build a voice-controlled robot, inspired by real-world applications of voice-controlled wheelchairs to asssit individuals with mobility impairments. Our robot recognizes and executes voice commands with LLM models and idetnfifies and avoid obstacles using lidars. The robot ecognizes and executes voice commands such as ‚Äúforward‚Äù, ‚Äúbackward‚Äù, ‚Äústop.‚Äù The robot integrates speech recognition, sensor-based obstacle avoidance, and autonomous decision-making using ROS.

## Features of the Car
- Car/VESC acts upon prompt input, control speed, duration, angle
- LLM voice recognition - prompt to parse into params
- Lidar Integration to identify obstacle 
- Reaction upon obstacle identification (stop), provide feedback to user 
- More complex reaction upon obstacle identification (costmap)
